# Action Plan: HumanOS Ecosystem Development

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-XX  
**Current Focus**: AI Tutor MVP → GCSE Tool → Skills Tree Rising

## Setup Complete ✅

- [x] GitHub repository created
- [x] Initial commit pushed
- [x] Go module initialized
- [x] Project structure organized
- [x] **Backend: Go (decision finalized)** ✅
- [x] **Complete classroom framework preserved** ✅ (moved to `/docs/reference/`)
- [x] **Individual concepts being extracted** ✅ (for AI tutor MVP)
- [x] **Deprecated code cleaned up** ✅ (removed `/project/backend/`)
- [x] **Documentation consolidated** ✅ (moved to `/docs/`)

## Strategic Overview

### The 80/20 Principle
**Focus on the 20% that generates 80% of value:**
1. **HumanOS Core** (barrier detection + intervention) - foundation for everything
2. **CHISG Integration** - makes AI responses smart
3. **Payment Infrastructure** - enables all revenue
4. **Three Target Products** - AI Tutor, GCSE Tool, Skills Tree

**Deliberately NOT doing (for now):**
- Full ESP suite completion (50-70% → 100% is massive work)
- Every service at 100% (diminishing returns)
- Features beyond MVP (perfectionism trap)

## Phase 1: Foundation & Income (Months 1-2)
**Goal**: Get employed AND launch first product MVP  
**Revenue Target**: $0 (employment) + $100-500/month (early adopters)

### Week 1-2: HumanOS Core to 50%
**Current**: 40% complete (barriers done, types consolidated, age filtering NOT done)
**Target**: 50% complete (production-ready barrier detection + age filtering)

**Tasks**:
- [x] Complete 5 barrier profile implementations ✅ DONE
- [x] **Consolidate Go backend structure** ✅ DONE
  - [x] Merged `/project/backend/` and `/backend/` into single structure
  - [x] Extracted types from main.go into `/internal/etp/types.go`
  - [x] Created proper package structure
  - [x] Moved barrier detection to `/internal/barriers/`
  
- [ ] **CRITICAL PRIORITY: Implement age-appropriate language adjustment** ⚠️ NEXT
  - [ ] Create `age_appropriateness.json` schema in `/shared/schemas/`
  - [ ] Implement `age_appropriate.go` in `/backend/internal/barriers/`
  - [ ] Build language filter implementation
  - [ ] Add developmental stage detection
  - [ ] Create response adjustment logic
  - [ ] Test with sample responses across age groups
  
  **Why this is critical**: "Too young and it will cause offence" - User requirement
  **Risk if skipped**: System could harm children through inappropriate language
  **Blocker**: Cannot proceed to production without this safeguard

- [ ] Build trauma detection with escalation
  - [ ] Pattern matching (sexual content, violence, neglect)
  - [ ] Severity scoring (1-4)
  - [ ] Automatic logging + alerting
  
- [ ] Create intervention selection engine
  - [ ] Brain state assessment (primal/emotional/rational)
  - [ ] Voltage calculation
  - [ ] Intervention matching logic

**Deliverable**: Clean Go backend with proper package structure, barrier detection, and age-appropriate responses

### Week 3-4: CHISG Enhancement & Integration
**Current**: 60% complete (separate project)
**Target**: 80% complete (integrated with HumanOS via Go API)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create Go client for CHISG API in `/backend/internal/integration/`
- [ ] Define shared types between HumanOS and CHISG
- [ ] Expand subject ontologies (GCSE Science, Math, English)

    // Validate no PII present
    if fc.privacyEngine.ContainsPII(pattern) {
        return errors.New("PII detected - pattern rejected")
    }
    
    // Aggregate with existing data
    fc.patternAggregator.Add(pattern)
    
    // Check if enough data for model update
    if fc.patternAggregator.ReadyForUpdate() {
        improvedModel := fc.trainModel()

### Month 12: Full ESP Suite Consideration
**Decision Point**: Do we complete the full ESP suite?

**Factors to consider**:
- Are AI Tutor + GCSE Tool + Skills Tree generating $5000+/month?
- Do we have school customers asking for full suite?
- Is there funding available (grants, investors)?
- Is completion worth 6-12 months of work?

**If YES, proceed with full ESP completion**:
- Allocate 6-12 months for remaining 30-50% of ESP components
- Target: School licenses at $10,000-30,000/year
- Need: Sales team, customer support, implementation consultants

**If NO, continue focusing on high-value products**:
- Double down on AI Tutor (expand subjects, add features)
- Grow GCSE Tool (more exam boards, international)
- Scale Solo Skills Map (enterprise version for companies)
- Explore new product ideas (language learning, test prep)

## Contingency Plans

### If Phase 1 Takes Longer Than Expected
**Adjust**:
- Move GCSE Tool to Month 4 (delay but don't skip)
- Simplify AI Tutor MVP (fewer features, faster launch)
- Reduce scope of Skills Tree Rising (manual workarounds)

### If No Job Offers by Month 2
**Adjust**:
- Double down on AI Tutor revenue (need to replace employment income)
- Consider contract/freelance work (AI consulting)
- Accelerate GCSE Tool launch (family need is real)

### If Products Don't Gain Traction
**Pivot Options**:
- B2B focus: Sell to schools/tutoring centers instead of direct-to-consumer
- White-label: License technology to existing EdTech companies
- Consulting: Offer AI implementation services using your tech stack
- Open-source + support model: Free product, charge for hosting/support

## Success Metrics Summary

- [ ] Revenue: $5000+/month or full-time employment secured

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- HumanOS complexity underestimated → Build incrementally, test continuously
- CHISG knowledge graph accuracy issues → Start with narrow domains, expand gradually
- Federated learning privacy concerns → Over-engineer privacy, get legal review

**Business Risks**:
- Low user adoption → Extensive beta testing, iterate based on feedback
- High customer acquisition cost → Focus on organic growth, word-of-mouth
- Competition from established players → Emphasize unique ETP approach

**Personal Risks**:
- Burnout from overwork → Set sustainable pace, don't skip Phase 1 employment
- Scope creep → Ruthlessly prioritize 80/20 features
- Perfectionism blocking launches → Ship MVPs, improve based on real usage

## Weekly Review Cadence

**Every Friday**:
- [ ] Review week's progress against action plan
- [ ] Update completion percentages
- [ ] Identify blockers + create unblock plan
- [ ] Plan next week's priorities
- [ ] Celebrate wins (even small ones!)

**Every Month**:
- [ ] Review phase progress
- [ ] Adjust timeline if needed
- [ ] Update revenue projections
- [ ] Reassess priorities based on results

## Final Notes

**Remember**:
- Perfect is the enemy of shipped
- 80% complete and launched beats 100% complete and never released
- User feedback is more valuable than your assumptions
- Revenue validates product-market fit
- This is a marathon, not a sprint

**When in doubt**:
1. Does this help students learn better? (Mission)
2. Will this generate revenue? (Sustainability)
3. Can this be done in 20% of the time for 80% of the value? (Efficiency)

If yes to all three → Do it.  
If no to any → Deprioritize or skip.

---

**Next Action**: Start Week 1 of Phase 1 → HumanOS Core to 50%

**Let's build this! 🚀**
